/**
 * An JNDI based interface to interact with a LDAP server.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * This doc will show you following things:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Reference Integrity</li>
 * <li>Continuous Usage of an Entity</li>
 * <li>Session Cache and Resource's Release</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <b>Reference Integrity</b>
 * <p/>
 * Each implementation should guarantee the reference integrity, which means its
 * okay to use <code>==</code> to compare two lookups via the given dn with all
 * the defined attributes during a same session:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SomeType entity = session.read(SomeType.class, dn);
 * SomeType anotherTry = session.read(SomeType.class, dn);
 * if (entity == anotherTry) { // this always works
 *     // ...
 * }
 * 
 * Map&lt;String, Object&gt; bar = session.read(Foo.class, dn, returningAttrs);
 * Map&lt;String, Object&gt; anotherBar = session.read(Foo.class, dn, returningAttrs);
 * if (bar == anotherBar) { // this might not working
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * But it may be not reliable to use <code>==</code> to compare two searches
 * directly via the given filter approach even during the same session:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * List&lt;SomeType&gt; entities = session.search(SomeType.class, filter);
 * List&lt;SomeType&gt; anotherTry = session.search(SomeType.class, filter);
 * if (entities == anotherTry) { // this might not working
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Still, the reference integrity should at least guarantee the possibility to
 * use <code>==</code> to distinguish one search result with another, which
 * means the following code snippet works (continue with the example shown
 * above):
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SomeType foo = entities.get(0);
 * if (anotherTye.get(0) == foo) { // in general this works, but in the real
 *                                 // circumstance, it might be broke by changes
 *                                 // which occurred in LDAP server side.
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * So, the safest approach is still using <code>equals()</code> method to do
 * comparisons.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * <b>Continuous Usage of an Entity</b>
 * <p/>
 * Another issue with session is about the missed real-time feature which is
 * caused by the possible logic in LDAP server: when one transient object is
 * persisted to the server, the changes which might happen in LDAP side might
 * not be reflected in session cache. So code which relies on real-time changes
 * in LDAP side should be avoided. And if you really need the changes, just do
 * an extra lookup! Note that this issue will has no compact with the basic
 * continuous usage of a persist entity (more details, please refer to
 * {@link #update(Object)}).
 * <p/>
 * 
 * <b>Session Cache and Resource's Release</b>
 * <p/>
 * Each session will maintain an internal cache for accelerating the lookup
 * process.
 * <p/>
 * Currently, there are two ways to get a session:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>
 * SessionFactory sessionFactory = SessionFactory.getDefaultFactory();
 * Session session = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
 * </code></li>
 * <li><code>
 * SessionFactory sessionFactory = SessionFactory.getDefaultFactory();
 * Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
 * </code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Using either approach, you both need to close the session to release all the
 * resource including cache, JNDI connection, etc. But different approaches lead
 * to different side effects when you forget to close the session.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If you use the second approach, the only side effect is that all the resource
 * the session occupies still there until the system garbage collection.</li>
 * <li>
 * If you use the first approach, the side effect include not only the session
 * itself but also the next session you get via
 * <code>sessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</code>. As you forget to close when
 * you last use the <b>current session</b>, the cache is not cleared, the
 * connection is not released and the session itself is not destroyed!!! In
 * general, this will lead to incorrect lookup process and break you code.</li>
 * </ul>
 * So, please remember to close the session no matter what approach you get it
 * (more details, please refer to {@link #close()})!!!
 * <p/>

    /**
     * Persist an object.
     * <p/>
     * It is decided by the implementor to refresh all the data of the given
     * object or not. That means, its not reliable to use the specified
     * <tt>obj</tt> after calling method:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * session.create(obj);
     * List&lt;User&gt; users = obj.getUsers(); // this might not working!!!
     * </pre>

     * And the safest way to get the most refreshed data of this <tt>obj</tt> is
     * to call {@link #read(Class, String)} and leave the original <tt>obj</tt>
     * behind:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * session.create(obj);

     * continuous usage. That means after invoking update(entity), its possible
     * to call update(entity) again and again.

     * session.update();
